Programming my life.

Emotions, basic instincts -> basic programming from DNA/history is running our body.

We can also program our selves.

These two "hardcoded" vs "self coded" programs work together.

Code = habit, instinct, conditioned response, trained response, auto-response.

Reduce negative code, increase positive code.

Engineering my life towards more meaningful, effective entity, by improving programs that runs body & mind.

Provide positive change to people around me, environment around me.

List of habits, exercises, mental frameworks, etc.
