A fact is a statement that is consistent with [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) or can be proven with
[evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence). The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability --- that is,
whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience). Standard
reference works are often used to check facts. [Scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) facts are verified
by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by [experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) or other
means).
