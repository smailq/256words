In general, an opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or statement that is not conclusive. It may deal with
[subjective](*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity) matters in which there is no conclusive finding, or it may
deal with facts which are sought to be disputed by the [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy)
that one is entitled to their opinions. What distinguishes [fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact) from opinion is
that facts are more likely to be verifiable, i.e. can be agreed to by the consensus of experts.
